# Be Informed General Layout

The general layout is a layout client based on modular UI services with a general application focus.

The general layout plugin is based on modular UI and includes Javascript, React, Redux and styled-components to transform the modular UI service components to page based HTML, which can be interpreted by web browsers. The general layout can be customized to adapt the 'look and feel requirements' of a project.
