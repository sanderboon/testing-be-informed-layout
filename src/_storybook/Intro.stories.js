      Storybook is a user interface development environment and playground for
      UI components. The tool enables developers to create components
      independently and showcase components interactively in an isolated
      development environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Storybook runs outside of the main app so users can develop UI components
      in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and
      requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      This storybook configuration displays the available components in this
      layout bundle, including the currently loaded theme.
